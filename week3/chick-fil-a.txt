Chick-fil-A customers expect great-tasting and high quality food when they visit our restaurants. That’s why our products are made with fresh, simple ingredients right in our own kitchen. Our chicken is 100% breast meat, with no fillers or additives. It is hand-breaded in our kitchens, and doesn’t arrive as a preformed patty or nugget. Our salads are freshly prepared and hand chopped. Our lemonade is freshly squeezed. Our tea is brewed fresh. Our biscuits are hand rolled and hand cut. We believe that providing ingredient information to our customers is important. Customers and their physicians can then make an informed decision concerning any particular allergy or intolerance. Please review the ingredient listing to see if the Chick-fil-A product in which you are interested contains any ingredient you should avoid. If you have concerns after reviewing the ingredient listing, you should consult with your physician for guidance. Chick-fil-A has exclusively used refined (heat processed) peanut oil to cook Chick-fil-A chicken menu items since Truett Cathy created the Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich in the 1960s. In 1999, we began labeling foil bags and Chick-fil-A Nuggets boxes to inform customers of our use of peanut oil. We also communicate our peanut oil message through our website, nutrition brochures, and menu boards. Since it is protein in allergenic foods that cause food allergy, highly refined oils are non-allergenic, research has shown that individuals with a severe peanut allergy have not had reactions to heat processed oils. However, people with a food allergy should avoid gourmet or cold pressed oils because they may contain allergenic proteins, which provide the flavor to the oil. We recommend that, prior to making a decision as to whether or not to eat any Chick-fil-A menu item, you consult with your physician. Our restaurants try very hard to accommodate customers with special requests. We offer several items that can be modified to fit into a vegetarian and vegan diet. However, because special requests are not already prepared, please call your local Chick-fi-A restaurant ahead of time to order your local meal or be prepared to wait a few minutes for your item to be specially made. The following list contains the items we consider to be vegetarian or vegan. We assume vegan to mean those persons who do not eat any foods of animal origin, including ingredients from animal origin. We recommend that you check the ingredients of each item yourself to be sure each item fits your needs. Chick-fil-A is proud to offer a balanced menu that features great-tasting choices. Our products are made with fresh, simple ingredients right in our own kitchen. Our chicken is 100% breast meat, with no fillers or additives. It is hand-breaded in our kitchens, and doesn’t arrive as a preformed patty or nugget.

We’re all about chicken, so you can be sure that we’re extremely selective about the chicken we serve. All of our chicken is 100% pure breast meat with no hormones, steroids, fillers or additives. Regulations of the Food & Drug Association prohibit the use of hormones in poultry in the U.S. All of our chicken is 100% pure breast meat with no fillers, additives or hormones. Our premium breast meat comes from chickens living on farms, where antibiotics are never given to promote growth. And because we’re all about chicken, we will continue having discussions with our farmers and suppliers to explore ways we can further reduce antibiotic usage. Our chicken is not free-range. The chickens used by Chick-fil-A are raised by family farmers in large enclosed barns designed to protect them from the weather, disease and predators. At Chick-fil-A, we partner with suppliers that share the same goal of continuous improvement and who treat animals with dignity and respect. Our founder, Truett Cathy, made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia. He has often shared that his decision was as much practical as spiritual. He believes that all franchised Chick-fil-A operators and restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest, spend time with family and friends, and worship if they choose to do so. That's why all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed on Sundays. It's part of our recipe for success. To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A is a privately held corporation; therefore, public stock offerings are not available.

Known for having a keen business sense, a work ethic forged during the Depression, and a personal and business philosophy based on biblical principles, Truett opened a tiny Atlanta diner in 1946, originally called the Dwarf Grill (later renamed The Dwarf House). He then introduced the chicken sandwich concept to the quick-service industry when he opened the first Chick-fil-A restaurant in Atlanta’s Greenbriar Shopping Center in 1967.

From time to time, however, high performing franchised operators may be offered an additional business opportunity. In 1995, a renegade cow, paintbrush in mouth, painted the three words EAT MOR CHIKIN on a billboard. From that day forward, the burger-eating landscape would forever be changed. These fearless cows, acting in enlightened self-interest, realized that when people eat chicken, they don’t eat them. Today, the cows’ herds have increased and their message reaches millions – on television, radio, the internet, and occasional water towers. Needless to say, Chick-fil-A fully endorses and appreciates the monumental efforts made by our most beloved bovine friends. We decided to use Holstein cows in Chick-fil-A ads for two reasons: The Holstein cow is the most recognizable cow. In advertising, quick and simple are always best. The Holstein cows are often used to represent bovines of all types (beef cows, etc.). The Chick-fil-A restaurant chain honors cows in a special way. Tuesday, July 14, 2015, has been established as Cow Appreciation Day to recognize the chain's famous advertising campaign featuring cows encouraging everyone to Eat Mor Chikin.

Credited with inventing Chick-fil-A's boneless breast of chicken sandwich, Mr Cathy founded Chick-fil-A in the early 1960s and pioneered the establishment of restaurants in shopping malls with the opening of the first Chick-fil-A restaurant at a mall in suburban Atlanta in 1967. Chick-fil-A has steadily grown to become the largest quick-service chicken restaurant chain in the United States, based on domestic annual sales with over 2,000 locations in 43 states and Washington DC. Chick-fil-A is still privately held and family owned. With 48 consecutive years of positive sales growth, Chick-fil-A has set itself apart by pioneering innovations and delicious products—including the ever-popular Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich. This begins in the restaurant – one customer at a time. We firmly believe in treating every person who comes through our doors with honor, dignity, and respect.

And our philanthropic giving reinforces that commitment to service by helping children and families in need. This is what makes us who we are.

The test of strength is making home without eating a nugget. When you come to a fork in the road, eat the spicy southwest salad. Waffle fries make every day better. My favorite thing about Chick-fil-A sauce is everything. Life is a journey that should lead to waffle fries. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today eat Chick-n-Minis. A peach milkshake a day keeps the winter away. Our fans love for our sauces doesn't go unnoticed. Take the longer route so that Chick-fil-A is on the way.
